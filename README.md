The Interactive Skills Enhancer (ISE) is an innovative Virtual Reality (VR) application designed to help children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Intellectual Disabilities (ID) develop essential social, cognitive, and life skills. Traditional educational methods often fall short in addressing these children's unique learning needs, necessitating more personalized, engaging, and adaptive solutions. ISE leverages VR to create immersive, interactive environments where children can practice social interactions, cognitive tasks, and daily activities in a safe, controlled setting.

The project features four key scenes: an introductory scene to acclimate the child to the VR environment, a social interaction scene emphasizing gestures and real-world scenarios, a cognitive learning scene integrating speech therapy with concepts like alphabets and colors, and a daily tasks scene simulating activities such as crossing the road or shopping. Advanced machine learning techniques, including gesture and speech recognition, offer real-time feedback and performance analysis.

ISE introduces a *Co-Player Mode, allowing children to engage in multiplayer interactions with parents, caregivers, or therapists. A unique aspect of this mode is the ability for parents or caregivers to participate remotely, providing real-time support and guidance from any location. Additionally, a customized **AI character* has been developed to promote positivity and optimism during interactions. By engaging with this AI, children are encouraged to mirror positive behaviors over time. 

With fully customizable experiences, real-time progress monitoring, and a reward-based learning system, ISE enhances social, cognitive, and practical life skills for children with ASD and ID, offering a groundbreaking solution to challenges in traditional education.
